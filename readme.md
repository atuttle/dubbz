You know, because you roll on them...

## What is it?

This application is a combined chat and D20 dice rolling app. I originally built it for fun and for my D&D crew to use, but it turned out to be a decent example of how to create and use a [Taffy](http://github.com/atuttle/taffy) REST api, so I decided to open source it.

## How do I use it?

Once you've got it installed on your server, just have each player open it up in their browser. In the upper right they can enter their character name ("handle") and chat and issue `/roll` commands.

To chat, just type your message and hit enter. To roll, type `/roll 1d20 a name for your roll`. The number of dice and size are dynamic, so for example, you could roll 3d8 or 1d4 or if you wanted to for some odd reason, you could roll 7d72. The name that you supply for your roll (everything after the dice count and size) will show up as a header for that block of rolls.
